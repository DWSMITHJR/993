# Deployment Checklist

## Pre-Deployment
- [ ] Run final performance tests
- [ ] Verify all forms and interactive elements
- [ ] Test on multiple devices and browsers
- [ ] Check for broken links
- [ ] Optimize and compress all images
- [ ] Minify CSS and JavaScript files

## Deployment Guide

This document outlines the deployment process for the Porsche 911 Carrera 4S (993) static website.

## Prerequisites

- SSH access to the production server
- rsync installed on both local and remote machines
- Basic knowledge of command line and shell scripting

## Deployment Steps

1. **Update Configuration**
   - Open `deploy.sh` in a text editor
   - Update the following variables:
     ```bash
     REMOTE_HOST="your-production-host.com"
     REMOTE_USER="username"
     REMOTE_PATH="/var/www/html"
     ```

2. **Make the Script Executable**
   ```bash
   chmod +x deploy.sh
   ```

3. **Run the Deployment**
   ```bash
   ./deploy.sh
   ```
   This will sync your local files to the remote server using rsync.

## Manual Deployment (Alternative)

If you prefer not to use the deployment script, you can manually upload files using an SFTP client like FileZilla or WinSCP.

## Post-Deployment

1. Verify the deployment by visiting your domain
2. Check file permissions on the server
3. Test all website functionality

## Rollback

To rollback to a previous version:
1. Use Git to checkout a previous commit
2. Run the deployment script again

## Troubleshooting

- **Permission Denied**: Ensure the remote user has write permissions to the target directory
- **Connection Refused**: Verify SSH access and firewall settings
- **File Not Found**: Check if the remote path exists and is accessible

## Security Considerations

- Use SSH keys for authentication
- Keep your server's software up to date
- Regularly backup your website files and database (if any)
- Use HTTPS with a valid SSL certificate
